# Tic-Tac-Toe-Cpp-Project

This was one of my first C++ projects, and overall it went really well!

Building a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game helped me understand many of the core fundamentals of C++, including:

- Basic syntax and structure
- Functions and control flow
- Working with arrays and game logic
- Input/output handling
- Simple project organization

It was a great learning experience that gave me confidence to move on to more advanced C++ topics. While it's a small project, it represents a solid step in my programming journey â€” and I'm proud of it!

Feel free to explore the code, and if you're just getting into C++ too, maybe this can be a helpful reference.
